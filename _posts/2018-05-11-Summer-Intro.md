With summers come the scorching sun, an array of refreshing beverages and lots of free time. We can't do much about the first two, but we certainly have some plans to help you overcome the inertia and make your summers productive in an intriguing way. The Club of Programmers, IIT BHU Varanasi presents "COPS Summer Camp", a summer-long initiative to help you pursue your interests by learning new stuff, assessing your progress and winning goodies along the way!

The Competitive Programming Group brings to you a series of topic-specific contests aimed at sharpening your skills at some of the most important data structures and algorithms. Tutorials and practice problems, along with their editorials, will be released a week before each contest. There will be a final contest at the end which will help you evaluate your improvement over the two months. This initiative is particularly beneficial for the second year students who are currently preparing for their corporate internships. The fact that there are goodies for the winners of each contest and prizes for the cumulative winner as well may help you find the required motivation!

For the Machine Learning enthusiasts, we introduce to you COPS ML Initiative, a learning by doing based initiative to help you get hands-on experience on some of the basic, yet important concepts of Machine Learning. We will provide you with learning material on a topic once every two weeks. The assignment on the same topic would be provided to you after one week and you have to submit the assignment at the end of the two weeks. At the end of the two months, a contest would be organized to give you the opportunity to apply the algorithms you learnt, test their variations and try to top the leaderboard! Prizes? Get the highest score after completing every assignment or top the leaderboard of the contest to be held at the end and be assured to win in either case.

The development guys need not feel estranged as the development group has planned out for you CSOC - "COPS Summer of Code". Students are required to join a slack channel, which will ease the communication process. CSOC will cover git, Linux, bash, web and android app development through 7 week-long, small projects. On successful completion of all the projects, you are ensured to win some amazing prizes!
