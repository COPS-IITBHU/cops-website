Welcome to COPS' Summer Of Code (CSOC). This is the first post in a series of development based week-long challenges, that will be posted every Thursday.

Your first challenge is to learn basics of Git. Git is a very popular version control system (VCS) used in Open Source development.

These two interactive tutorials - https://try.github.io and https://learngitbranching.js.org/ - will introduce you to basic Git commands.

You're required to complete at least 10 levels of both the tutorials. Submit your progress by taking a screenshot of your device screen and submitting it [in this form](https://goo.gl/32KPFh) by next Thursday.

Join [COPS' Slack workspace](cops-iitbhu.slack.com), if you haven't already. We will be using it for entertaining doubts. Also, create your account on GitHub, if you don't already have one.
