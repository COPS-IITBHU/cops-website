CSoC is a platform where all the interested people get together to teach and learn the best of programming, to give direction to the future of the students as a potential source in the industry.
<p>COPS Summer of Code 19 received a huge response, not only from the students of IIT (BHU), but also from the students of other colleges. There had been:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 7k reach with more than 1000 likes and shares on Facebook pages.
</li>
<li>From the forks, a total of 110 students participated in Development and Machine Learning.
</li>
<li>Across all the assignments, 80 Pull Requests and a total of 197 forks of the repositories were made.
</li>
<li>More than 200 students took part in the CP Contest from IIT (BHU) as well as other colleges.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There had been a similar response from the previous editions of CSoC. COPS Summer of Code 18 was able to gain a total reach of 6.9k with 834 likes and shares on Facebook posts. Out of more than 200 students participating, 93 solved CSoC assignments and were pleased with the knowledge they earned with the help of it.</p>
</p>
<p>The main objective of CSoC is to help people explore various major as well as minor fields of Computer Science which they’ve heard about a lot, but don’t know where to start. Right from the very basic of each of these fields, we take the participants to the maximum possible level of the subject up to their potential to grasp knowledge. as CSoC carries no boundaries, the participants are free to explore and take help from us. Development, Machine Learning and Competitive programming will be the three main sectors that will be dealt with during the CSoC 2020 programme. Exciting resources, assignments and mentorship will be provided to all students during the programme.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Machine learning:</b>  The aim of the programme is to equip the participants with the necessary tools and techniques of Machine Learning and to give an idea regarding the various avenues and developments taking place in the field. The students will be taught about Data Science, encouraged to participate in competitive Machine Learning, and exposure will also be give to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, two of the hot topics in the research field.
</li>
<li><b>Development:</b> The aim is to involve people in open source contributions and to get a taste of actual development in a collaborative effort. The resources for Backend, Frontend, Android Development as well as Web VR will be provided to the students on a weekly basis. By the end of the program, students should be comfortable with whatever development environment they've set up, basic technologies in web development and how to contribute to open source projects and to solve their issues.
</li>
<li><b>Competitive Programming:</b> The aim is to give exposure to students regarding the various concepts, tools and tricks in competitive programming. To encourage a good culture, there will be a 7 day long practice contest, with carefully picked interesting questions of various topics from beginner to expert level, which one can solve along with studying the materials. This will be carried on with a discussion on Telegram and Google Group, where one can clear their doubts. Tutorials and practice problems, along with their editorials will be released for every contest.
